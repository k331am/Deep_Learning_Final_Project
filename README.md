# CU Boulder Deep Learning Final Project

This repository contains the jupyter notebook used for the deep learning final project.

If you want to try running the code yourself, keep in mind that it may take quite a while (15 minutes or more) for some cells, since little of the training actually leverages the power of GPU acceleration

Please do not allow this notebook to influence your financial decisions. There has been __zero__ backtesting.
